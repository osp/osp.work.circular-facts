_Circular Facts is an informal think-tank and a mutual support structure that
works as a hub for the production and dissemination of artistic projects. The
emphasis of the collaboration is on finding non-bureaucratic ways of working
together, the sharing of imaginative thinking, and open-ended forms of
circulation. _
